# Introduction

Guetzli is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density at high
visual quality. Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30% smaller than
images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg. Guetzli generates only
sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to faster decompression speeds they offer.

# Building

1.  Get a copy of the source code, either by cloning this repository, or by
    downloading an
    [archive](https://github.com/google/guetzli/archive/master.zip) and
    unpacking it.
2.  Install [Bazel](https://www.bazel.io) by following its [installation
    instructions](https://www.bazel.io/versions/master/docs/install.html).
3.  Run `bazel build -c opt :guetzli` in the directory this README file is in.

# Using

To try out Guetzli you need to [build](#building) or
[download](https://github.com/google/guetzli/releases) the Guetzli binary. The
binary reads a PNG or JPEG image and creates an optimized JPEG image:

```bash
bazel-bin/guetzli [--quality Q] [--verbose] original.png output.jpg
bazel-bin/guetzli [--quality Q] [--verbose] original.jpg output.jpg
```

Note that Guetzli is designed to work on high quality images (e.g. that haven't
been already compressed with other JPEG encoders). While it will work on other
images too, results will be poorer. You can try compressing an enclosed [sample
high quality
image](https://github.com/google/guetzli/releases/download/v0/bees.png).

You can pass a `--quality Q` parameter to set quality in units equivalent to
libjpeg quality. You can also pass a `--verbose` flag to see a trace of encoding
attempts made.

Please note that JPEG images do not support alpha channel (transparency). If the
input is a PNG with an alpha channel, it will be overlaid on black background
before encoding.
